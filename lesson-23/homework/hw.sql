       RIGHT('0' + CAST(DAY(dt) AS VARCHAR(2)), 2) AS monthprefixedwithzero
FROM dates;

Puzzle 2: In this puzzle you have to find out the unique Ids present in the table. 
You also have to find out the SUM of Max values of vals columns for each Id and RId. 
For more details please see the sample input and expected output.

;WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id, rid ORDER BY vals DESC) AS rn
    FROM mytabel
)
SELECT count(distinct id) AS DISTINCT_IDS , rid, SUM(vals) AS total_max_vals
FROM cte
WHERE rn = 1
GROUP BY rid;


Puzzle 3: In this puzzle you have to get records with at least 6 characters and maximum 10 characters. 
Please see the sample input and expected output.

SELECT * FROM TestFixLengths
WHERE LEN(VALS) BETWEEN 6 AND 10

Puzzle 4: In this puzzle you have to find the maximum value for each Id 
and then get the Item for that Id and Maximum value. 
Please check out sample input and expected output.

;WITH CTE AS(
select *,
		DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY VALS DESC) AS VALSS
FROM TESTMAXIMUM)
SELECT ID, ITEM, VALS FROM CTE
WHERE VALSS = 1

Puzzle 5: In this puzzle you have to first find the maximum value for each Id and DetailedNumber, 
and then Sum the data using Id only. Please check out sample input and expected output.

;with cte as(
SELECT *,
		dense_rank() over (partition by detailednumber order by vals desc) as rnk
from sumofmax)
select id, sum(vals) as sumofmax
from cte
group by id, rnk
having rnk = 1


Puzzle 6: In this puzzle you have to find difference 
between a and b column between each row and if the difference is not equal to 0 
then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. 
Now you need to replace this zero with blank.
Please check the sample input and the expected output.

;WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
           a - b AS output
    FROM TheZeroPuzzle
)
SELECT id, a,b,
       CASE 
           WHEN output = 0 THEN ''
           ELSE CAST(output AS VARCHAR(10))
       END AS outputt
FROM cte;
